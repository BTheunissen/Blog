Since I attended the Amazon Web Services Dev Day conference back in September, I've been meaning to replatform my blog to Gatsby and spend some of the AWS credits I was so generously showered with.

This is my new blog, using the awesome [Lumen starter for Gatsby](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen), many thanks to all of the contributors to the project.

The blog has been put together using a variety of AWS resources such as CloudFront for a CDN/TLS solution, Route53 for all my DNS needs, and hosting the website directly from an S3 bucket using the cheap and easy static website hosting feature.

Hopefully I'll be able to share any musing, tech related or otherwise on this blog into the future.

Ciao!
